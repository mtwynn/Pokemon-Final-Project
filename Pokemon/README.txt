Instructions: To run this code, launch the main method, "Launcher.java". Alternatively, double click on the .jar

file to run the program.





In the code I am presenting to you, my aim was to learn as much as I could about how a basic RPG tile-based game code

was put together, personalizing it along the way to fit what I was trying to achieve. Of course, the

tutorials I followed did not cover some aspects, such as Battle Mode and implementing Pokemon to use in those

battles, and for those I had to code them myself. I also had to figure out a way to create an interactive menu 

screen, complete with user UI at the simplest form, given by a start button and a How To Play button. After creating

the UI, I was basically ready to begin shaping the code to fit my needs. Additionally I had to figure out a way to 
 
import sound into the file, which I found with a little bit of digging. Essentially, the code for the game's 

functionality at its very core belongs to CodeNMore. and is not mine. I am simply modifying it so that it's more 

like the game I am familiar with.




List of Things I have Done: 

- Learn how to code RPG Tile-based game in Java (about half the time spent)

- Added audio with the Sound class

- Created other states based on State class given by tutorial (GameStates for each world, InstructionState when
button pressed on main menu)

- Implemented Pokemon Creatures

- Created the Battle State to use these Pokemon in

- Figured out how to set other Creatures to move on their own

- Figured out how to make a Player spawn correctly when entering map (Player spawn location is dynamic, not static)



Presentation: 

- Manager classes (UI, Key, Mouse, Entity, Assets, Sound, Tile, Pokemon)
- Menu, Intro to States
- Game State, how it renders and ticks variables. 
   - World, how the World is passed in from .txt file
- Alternating worlds, demonstrate
- Battle Mode, demonstrate
   - Gold earnings
   - Attack ratios 
   - Moves 
   - Three buttons of attack, swaps, and forfeits
- Inheritance explanation
- Secret level
- Difficulties?
